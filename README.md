# PARASITIC_AnalysisOF-RLC-Circuits
The prevailing techniques for estimating power, RLC parasitics, and delays in VLSI circuits rely on intricate mathematical models, often resulting in inaccuracies when applied to unique circuit architectures. Adders, fundamental to circuit design, necessitate precise analysis considering factors like parasitic capacitance (C), resistance (R), power consumption, and maximum operating current. Addressing these challenges demands specific and accurate methodologies.
